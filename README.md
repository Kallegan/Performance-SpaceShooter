# Performance-SpaceShooter

3D Space Shooter using DOTS.

Mostly followed older toutorials and adapting the code to my needs and to the 2021.3.13f1 version. 

Spawning a huge amount of asteroids with a random spawn location, random direction and rotation. If it goes out of bound it gets cleaned up and another one spawns. Wanted to make use of some fracture but didn't find the time.

Player shooting with projectiles that's deleted after a time limit is reached. 

Movement with physics. 

TODO: Enemyspawner with waves of enemies.

Since using DOTS is very different I've relied on using a lot from Unity example projecs and https://dots-tutorial.moetsi.com/ and adapted to my project.
