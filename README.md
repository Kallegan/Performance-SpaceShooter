# Performance-SpaceShooter

3d space shooter using DOTS.

Mostly followed older toutorials and adapting the code to my needs and to the 2021.3.13f1 version. 

Had to redo my project since the base game I built was another unity version/render piplines/DOTS etc so the project isn't very impressive as of now.

Spawning a huge amount of asteroids with a random spawn location, random direction and rotation. If it goes out of bound it gets cleaned up and another one spawns. Wanted to make use of some fracture but didn't find the time.

Player shooting with projectiles that's deleted after a time limit is reached. 

Movement with physics. 

TODO: Enemyspawner with waves of enemies.
